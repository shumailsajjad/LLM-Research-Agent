## 🧠 Starter Agent Projects

Curious how LLM agents "think and act"?  
These notebooks will help you build that intuition step-by-step.

📁 `starter_agent/` includes:

1. **`01_building_an_agent_from_scratch.ipynb`**  
   ➤ A pure Python ReAct-style agent.  
   Learn how an LLM can reason step-by-step and take actions using simple prompts and tool functions.

2. **`02_building_with_langgraph.ipynb`**  
   ➤ A chatbot powered by **LangGraph** that uses **Tavily AI** as a search tool.  
   This shows how to add external tools into your LangGraph node flow to improve reasoning and answer quality.

Both notebooks are beginner-friendly and build a strong foundation before jumping into my master research agent.
