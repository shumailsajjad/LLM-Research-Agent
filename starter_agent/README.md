## 🧠 Starter Agent Projects

Curious how LLM agents "think and act"?  
These notebooks will help you build that intuition step by step.

📁 `starter_agent/` includes:

1. **`01_building_an_agent_from_scratch.ipynb`**  
   A pure Python implementation of a ReAct-style agent.  
   Learn how an LLM reasons through tasks and invokes tools using only thought-action-observation loops.

2. **`02_building_with_langgraph.ipynb`**  
   A LangGraph-powered chatbot enhanced with **Tavily AI** for web search.  
   Demonstrates how to incorporate external tools into a graph-based agent workflow for smarter decision-making.

These examples are beginner-friendly and build a solid foundation before exploring the full research agent in `research_agent/`.
